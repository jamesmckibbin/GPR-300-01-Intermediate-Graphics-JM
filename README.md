# Hello!

This is a project for my Intermediate Graphics and Animation Programming class in which I implemented multiple processing and pipeline techniques using DirectX 12.

My source code is located inside the DirectXPurgatory folder.

Thank you so much to iedoc on www.braynzarsoft.net for their amazing DirectX 12 initialization tutorial!
